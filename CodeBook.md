# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project Codebook 

# Data 

Data for this project is from UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones data set and consists of mutiple time series of acceleromter readings from subjects performing a variety of activities. Also included are data on the test subjects, activities and measurement names. In the interest of space, the raw data for this project is not inlcuded.  It can be found at :

# Instructions

1. Merge the training test data sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data in step 4, create a second independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity.

# Final Output 

The final output is tidy_data.txt, the output from step 5 above.  It consists of subjects, activities and averages for each variable. Variables included are listed below:
